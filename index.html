    <h3>what's this?</h3>
    <p>I've been into narrative games lately, and it makes me want to write interactive fiction again.</p>
    <p>But I keep coming up with these really big ideas that would probably take years to write, if I could even do it justice...<p>
    <p>I also feel like I've forgotten how to make small games. I miss doing that. So I'm deciding that all these stories I want to tell, I'm just going to try telling them through very small games.</p>
